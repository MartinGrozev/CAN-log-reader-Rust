CAN Log Decoder - Multi-Network BLF Support
Version: 0.1.0-session12
Date: 2026-01-18

WHAT'S NEW:
✅ Fixed endless loop with multi-network BLF files (LIN, Ethernet, FlexRay, GPS, etc.)
✅ Added support for 80+ BLF object types
✅ Enhanced logging to show which network types are being skipped
✅ Production-ready for real automotive logs

QUICK START:
============

1. Basic Usage (no signal definitions):
   decode_log.exe your_log_file.blf --limit 100

2. With DBC definitions:
   decode_log.exe your_log_file.blf --dbc powertrain.dbc --limit 100 --verbose

3. With ARXML definitions:
   decode_log.exe your_log_file.blf --arxml system.arxml --limit 100 --verbose

4. Full analysis:
   decode_log.exe your_log_file.blf --dbc powertrain.dbc --arxml system.arxml --verbose > output.txt

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
===============

You should see:
- Network type info messages (e.g., "Skipping LIN object type 20...")
- Decoded CAN/CAN-FD messages with timestamps
- Summary statistics showing:
  * Total frames processed
  * CAN frames decoded
  * Unique message names
  * Signal values (with --verbose)

WHAT TO CHECK:
=============

✅ No endless "BadMagic" errors
✅ Clean startup and processing
✅ Info messages showing which non-CAN networks detected
✅ Statistics showing expected number of CAN frames
✅ Decoded signal values (if DBC/ARXML provided)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
===============

Problem: Still seeing BadMagic errors
Solution: Check README.md for details on adding new object types

Problem: No CAN frames found
Solution:
- Check if file contains only non-CAN data
- Verify file is valid BLF format
- Try with a different log file

Problem: Wrong frame count
Solution: Compare with CANoe/CANalyzer statistics
